Piezoelectric Sensor–Based Smart Farming system using ESP8266 for automated irrigation and sustainable agriculture through energy harvesting.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a smart and sustainable farming system using a piezoelectric sensor and IoT technology. The system harvests energy from mechanical vibrations using a piezoelectric sensor and monitors soil moisture to automate irrigation. An ESP8266 (NodeMCU) microcontroller enables real-time monitoring and control.

## Objectives
- To utilize piezoelectric sensors for energy harvesting
- To monitor soil moisture levels
- To automate irrigation using a relay-controlled water pump
- To promote sustainable and smart farming practices

##  Hardware Components
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- Piezoelectric Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Connecting Wires
- Power Supply

##  Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 Board Package
- Serial Monitor
- GitHub

## Working Principle
1. Piezoelectric sensor generates voltage when vibration occurs.
2. Soil moisture sensor checks soil dryness.
3. If soil is dry and piezo output is detected, irrigation starts.
4. When soil becomes moist, the pump turns OFF automatically.
5. System supports efficient water usage and smart farming.
